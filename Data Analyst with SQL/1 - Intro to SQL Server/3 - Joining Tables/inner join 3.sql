/*
We've seen how to join 2 tables together - album with track, and album with artist. In this exercise, you'll join all three tables to pull together a more complete result set. You'll continue using INNER JOIN, but you need to specify more than one.

Here, note that because both track and artist contain a name column, you need to qualify where you are selecting the columns by prefixing the column name with the table name.

Instructions
------------
Qualify the name column by specifying the correct table prefix in both cases.
Complete both INNER JOIN clauses to join album with track, and artist with album.

SELECT track_id,
-- Enter the correct table name prefix when retrieving the name column from the track table
  track.name AS track_name,
  title as album_title,
  -- Enter the correct table name prefix when retrieving the name column from the artist table
  artist.name AS artist_name
FROM track
  -- Complete the matching columns to join album with track, and artist with album
INNER JOIN album on track.album_id = album.album_id  
INNER JOIN artist on album.artist_id = artist.artist_id;
