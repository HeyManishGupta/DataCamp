/*
Here, you'll continue to practice your INNER JOIN skills. We'll use the album table as last time, but will join it to a new table - artist - which consists of two columns: artist_id and name

Instructions
------------
Select the album_id and title columns from album (the main source table name).
Select the name column from artist and alias it as artist.
Identify a common column between the album and artist tables and perform an inner join.
