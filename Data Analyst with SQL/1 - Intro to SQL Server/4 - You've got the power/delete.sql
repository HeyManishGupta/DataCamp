You may not have permissions to delete from your database, but it is safe to practice it here in this course!

Remember - there is no confirmation before deleting. When you execute the statement, the record(s) are deleted immediately. Always ensure you test with a SELECT and WHERE in a separate query to ensure you are selecting and deleting the correct records. If you forget so specify a WHERE condition, you will delete ALL rows from the table.
