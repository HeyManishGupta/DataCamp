/*
Now it's finally time to migrate the data into the new tables. You'll use the following pattern:

INSERT INTO ... 
SELECT DISTINCT ... 
FROM ...;
It can be broken up into two parts:

First part:

SELECT DISTINCT column_name1, column_name2, ... 
FROM table_a;
This selects all distinct values in table table_a â€“ nothing new for you.

Second part:

INSERT INTO table_b ...;
Take this part and append it to the first, so it inserts all distinct rows from table_a into table_b.

One last thing: It is important that you run all of the code at the same time once you have filled out the blanks.

Instructions
